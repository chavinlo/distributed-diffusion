Note: To use 8Bit inside a docker container, you must use a devel image. Runtime images will only work once, then crash.

# Swarm Diffusion: Decentralized SD Model Training
Train Stable Diffusion models across the internet with multiple peers

By leveraging the power of multiple computers as peers, this project enables the training of machine learning models across the internet with high efficiency and fault-tolerance. The distributed training is facilitated by a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) which ensures that all peers are able to connect and share their training data. The resulting model is then averaged across all peers, ensuring that the final model is highly accurate and reliable. This decentralized approach allows for efficient and scalable model training without the need for a master node.

# Issues & Bugs:

- Checkpoints save too often and could eat a ton of disk sapce (Just set a high save steps number)
- No security whatsoever (see hivemind's CLIP averaging (not related to openai clip at all))
